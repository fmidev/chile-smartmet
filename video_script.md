Forestry operations depend on good trafficability of terrain and dirt roads on location. 
The Finnish Forest Centre has produced trafficability maps based on high resolution laser scanning of most parts of Finland.
These maps call for dry or winter coditions for many forests in Finland to be trafficable. 

Our app gives a 6 month foresight identifying good or bad conditions within the 6 classess of the trafficability map.

Then you open https://harvesterseasons.com/ it can use your location information to zoom in on the surrounding area and show
the 6 month forecast for it in a graph with summer and winter condition analysis. You can navigate the date on the map below 
with a slider, back and forward buttons or play to go thru all dates. 

Each date map translate the two indexes for specific parcels on the area of the forecast for that day. Good winter conditions 
allow forest machines in all terrains, good summer conditions leave out winter classes. Bad conditions are identified for areas
that need dry conditions. Seasonal forecasts are far from certain, so we also have situation where we can't predict conditions.

Below the map three graphs go into detail explaining the conditions background. The analysis uses the EU Copernicus climate 
change services seasonal forecasts, which are a tool combining climatology and large scale weather pattern teleconnections to 
indicate directions of future climate. So graphs are not daily weather forecasts, but a range of possibilities for each day 
and our analysis is based on 90% of these to concure on a good or bad condition. The graphs show all 51 members of the 
bias-adjusted and post processed prediction ensemble interpolated to the location on the map. It represents many square 
kilometres, not one spot as the resolution of the models used ranges from 5 to to 100 kilometers. 

Summer good/dry conditions are based on soil wetness below 10 cm ground being under 40 % with 90% of prediction members.
Winter good conditions are either based on soil temperature at 20 cm below ground being under 0 C or snow depth being more than 40 cm.
Again 90% of prediction members have to agree.

The app allows browsing the map and clicking for analysis graphs all over Northern Europe, but trafficability analysis is available 
only in Finland with over 80% of land area covered. In areas without trafficability analysis the map shows average soil wetness, 
temperature and snow depth predictions, but the information is intended to be coarse as this information should not be considered 
precise, it is estimating future climatology of the variable. Also good and bad trafficability is analyzed in the graphs, but it
can't be translated for particular parcels on the map.

Come and try the app. The service is developed with EU support and it allows this service to be available for free for a one year
trial phase. Check it out and we welcome feedback, link is behind more information. Enjoy the service!
